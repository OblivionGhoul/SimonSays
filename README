This project implements the classic Simon Says game using SystemVerilog. The design includes a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control the game's logic, a tone generator for sound feedback, a random sequence generator, and modules to control LEDs and a 7-segment display. The game involves:
  Displaying a sequence of LED flashes and tones.
  Allowing the player to repeat the sequence using buttons.
  Increasing the sequence length for each successful round.
  Providing visual and auditory feedback for success or failure.

Module Descriptions
fsm.sv
  Manages the game’s state transitions.
  Outputs the current LED, tone frequency, and feedback signals.
  Handles player input and sequence validation.
  Random_Sequence_Generator.sv
  Generates a randomized 2-bit sequence for LED control.
  Uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) for randomness.
Tone_Generator.sv
  Produces sound signals based on the specified frequency.
  Toggles sound output at the correct timing using the system clock.
LED_and_Display_Control.sv
  Manages LED displays for sequence feedback.
  Controls the 7-segment display to show the player's score or a “You Lose” message.
top_level.sv
  Integrates all modules into a single design.
  Connects FSM, random sequence generator, tone generator, and display controls.
  Interfaces with the hardware inputs (buttons, clock, reset) and outputs (LEDs, sound, 7-segment display).
